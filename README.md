# AAPM Annual Meeting 2023 Data Science Bootcamp: Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Open medical imaging data sets can be impactful resources for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, including validation and external testing. This bootcamp is designed to help attendees get started with exploring and preparing MRI data for AI methods, including deep learning. The presentations will include a practical overview to accessing open MRI data sets (such as at http://data.midrc.org, the Medical Imaging and Data Resource Center) and preparing data for deep learning. Open-source tools for getting started will be provided.

Learning Objectives:
1. Become familiar with resources for accessing open MRI data sets
2. Understand how to develop a pipeline to access, download, and begin working with open MRI data sets
3. Understand techniques for pre-processing MRI data for deep learning
